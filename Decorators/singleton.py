'''The basic idea is that we will define a dictionary and store the instance into it. 
Whenever weâ€™re trying to instantiate the class, the dictionary is checked. 
If there is no instance, instantiate the class and return the instance. 
Otherwise, do not instantiate the class again, just return the existing instance.'''
